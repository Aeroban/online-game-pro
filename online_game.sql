Either way, this game won\'t disappoint. Characters+ I enjoy three characters: Karlee, Holly, and Hoffman. Karlee (bae) is basically a model geared up with a Hot Topic edge lord starter kit, whose personality comes out of a 90\'s, 2000\'s teen horror film; she barely shows any emotion and sounds cold as ice, aside from when she throws grenades \'cause her voice sounds like a weird bird/cat in distress: \"InCoMinG!! \"LoOK OuT!!\" She\'s fierce, so she gets a pass. Holly is basically female Ellis with an IQ over 7, and Hoffman is the Kkona conspiracy theorist; as a plus size gentleman, he\'s more likable than L4D2\'s Coach in his own ways, or at least on par with his personality. - All the other characters are/have cringe personalities, bland, and just plain boring. Evangelo acts like he\'s fourteen, Doc has a made up accent which sounds like a mix between South African, Posh English, etc. but sounds nothing like a Singaporean accent. Walker has three to four unintentionally funny lines, but his PTSD makes him droll. Introverted Jim spends more time talking to animals than people it seems, which suits his character fine, but not for this game. + You can customise your character\'s outfit; it\'s hit or miss, some of the outfits are meh... Same with guns, banners, etc. The sprays and banners are pretty sweet, though, incorporating popular internet memes. Karlee gets a cosmetic where she\'s bald, so that\'s 10/10 customisation.Sound -The sound is trash in this game; maybe a 6.5/10. You can\'t hear zombies coming at you most of the time. In L4D2, you couldn\'t hear specials if you moved too quickly through the map; here, you just get smacked out of the blue \'cause zombies\' footsteps don\'t have sound. The music makes the game feel boring, plain and simple; terrible chapter completion music. As for the jukebox music in a certain chapter, it plays kkona music so loud and you don\'t have the option of turning it off. That chapter gives secondhand embarrassment \'cause of how corny it is and you have to suffer through it.BUGS/GLITCHES-Phantom bullets: you shoot, you see recoil, but nothing comes outta your gun. Sometimes you spam fire, but nothing comes out of your gun until the fifth shot. Special infected, ridden, whatever, go through and into the ground, rocks, etc. It\'s embarrassing. If you use combat knife as your melee and then switch to your firearm, the animations turn to soup and you hold both weapons awkwardly. A problem that the devs acknowledge and have yet to fix, is starting the next chapter in an act with an unloaded secondary weapon. Gameplay -Animations are CoD like, and the movement is stiff; the game feels unfinished at times with some of its abrupt and budget cutscenes.+The card system is the best part of the game: you can play shotgun, melee, medic, money builds, etc. and everything in between :) So for those coming from L4D2 thinking it\'s the same experience, they\'re in for a rude awakening. +Copper is the game\'s currency; you use it to buy cards, weapon attachments, health, etc. in the game, especially at the beginning of a chapter. It makes planning for higher difficulties interesting and fun.- The game doesn\'t use Source engine, it just feels weird in a game like this. Everyone and their granny would agree; some people say it feels smoother, though ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬ØDifficultyI honestly think everyone will get what they want. It\'s a shame there\'s no \"Realism\" mode, though. People shouldn\'t start the game in veteran; doesn\'t matter how many games they play. Otherwise it\'ll be backpack simulator for those who worked up to that difficulty. Nightmare is basically reserved for players who\'ve unlocked every card in the game, and have players on their team who know what they\'re doing. Conclusion Easily recommended: 8/10. Not L4D2, but just as fun. NO COMMUNITY MODS, just incoming DLC, and that\'s a GOOD THING. \"The mods are what keep the game alive\" is every die hard L4D2 person\'s reason for playing that game. With this game, hopefully the devs keep investing in content for the next 5 years instead of letting it rot and cancelling a potential sequel.', 1, '2021-10-27 13:10:49', NULL),

It wasn\'t ready for release, and it\'s definitely not good for price. Pick it up if it gets the issues patched/rebalanced and the price dropped.Longer version:I\'m going to be talking about Campaign pretty much entirely, because that\'s what I\'ve played and usually play in these sorts of games. And I\'m going to reference L4D because I\'ve played that extensively and it\'s used as reference in their marketing so... yeah.The game is fun when it works. As many have mentioned the bots are so buggy as to be downright useless sometimes. Bots get caught on rare and strange phenomena such as Small Pile of Dirt and Fence, and they seem instinctively attracted to killing Special Ridden at the worst moment, resulting in a player being yeeted into the sea from the blast or covered in Ridden-attractive mucous while pinned by enemies. And even playing with humans there are glitches ranging from simple achievements not dinging to being randomly booted to control a Bot or even prompted to spawn Ridden (???). Just quality of life things that will crop up every other round or so and make you either sigh or groan and maybe quit the game.Tone and gameplay-wise, this game isn\'t L4D but even knowing that going in the game feels kind of pulled in different directions. One of L4D\'s greatest points was the development of rapport and in-jokes between the characters, like Francis\' \"I hate X\" and Nick being less of a jerk to everyone, which meant that the characters felt different even when in gameplay they were the same. It didn\'t have to be comedic, it just had to feel like there was something.B4B\'s characters are all different in terms of gameplay, with different traits and buffs they add to the team. And while this adds customisability to gameplay, I found it actually removed enjoyment overall. This is because it means you tend to find yourself playing the same characters repeatedly because you like the playstyle, even if you hate the character. Alternatively, a character may tick you off so much (looking at you Karlee) that even if the playstyle works for you you just avoid them. Add this to little character development and what sounds like a smaller pool of voicelines and the characters end up feeling kind of isolated from one another rather than a real team as they try to portray. And they feel a bit flat and empty in general.Also the different classes issue wombo-comboes with the Card system, where you slowly build a deck by hitting some achievements and paying Supply Points (earned at the end of rounds played with other people) to buy your way through the Supply Lines. But this comes back to bite you because, for instance, if you like playing healer support like me and someone else picks Doc, you might be screwed because you\'ve been buying supply lines based on that and have made a deck based on that. You probably have some cards in your inventory that will work, sure, but they aren\'t in a deck so you can\'t use them. L4D it didn\'t matter if your favourite character got picked because they were all functionally the same. And oh, the Supply Points. You can\'t earn them solo, you *have* to play online, and you get fewer of them if you play on the easy difficulty. Fine, you might say, just play on Medium but the balance and scaling in this game is majorly busted to the point of not even being funny. It could be fun and challenging, but then you get a glitch and the run is lost. It\'s immensely frustrating, and combined with the one-new-card-a-round system it\'s just a complete pain. There\'s no way to increase that, by the way. All additional objectives offer copper and a couple more Supply Points. You can find cards or buy offered cards during levels but it\'s really not what\'s needed to fix the issue at hand.So you grind... on the same maps in the lower difficulty. The repetition sets in. You can play with friends and have fun, yeah, but you learn the maps pretty quick and the amount of \"additional\" dialogue feels pretty thin on the ground. In L4D you could have conversations between characters before leaving saferooms or observations made in the field, little quips about the world before the fall, and the closest thing I\'ve found to that is one conversation between Doc and Mom on one level. I\'ve actually stopped looking at objects and signs in levels as much because it felt like a waste of time when your character seems to be nearly catatonic if the world around them isn\'t actively trying to make their insides outsides.I\'m not going to talk about the whole quality/looting mechanic. I actually kind of like it, even if it feels a little clumsy or like it breaks flow sometimes. I find the weapon improvement with Act progression fun even if it doesn\'t necessarily make sense. I\'ve gone on enough, I\'m sure you get the idea. The game is promising and it has potential. But even after getting a closed beta (which I also briefly played in) it\'s still horrendously buggy and feels unfinished. I really want them to keep working on it, but the above is honest criticism concentrated from many post-quit conversations of \"what the hell was that\". This game is 90AUD, and there\'s already upcoming DLC (PATCH YOUR GAME FIRST) for 60AUD. That\'s insane.Fun fact: This game was actually bought for me by a good friend and we broke it in together. And I feel *bad* he bought it for me because of how many times we\'ve quit the game with our heads shaking. I\'ve heard that they had to keep going back to the drawing board for this game and it does feel that way.A game can be fun while being bugged, but this isn\'t the one.

I have over 2000 hours playing Left4Dead and L4D2. So I was really excited to finally see a 3 in this franchise. The game is fun, but it won\'t have much replayability or longevity because the main thing that made the L4D game popular was the versus campaign (why leave out the most popular thing in the previous games?). WIthout the versus campaign game mode, there is no point to build up skill in the game. Once you unlock a few things to try out the variation of play, it\'s game over.Pros+Unique playstyles with the card system and character abilities+Unique missions, map types, big enemies to kill and objectives to achieve+Scary feel to the game with great suspense+L4D nostalgia+Focus on teamworkMeh~Story is ok and somewhat interesting~Skins that you don\'t care about because it is dark and you get covered in guts and blood~Unique mutations; while a great idea, you just don\'t care about them when you don\'t have a purpose for them. See Swarm Mode below.Cons-Soul of the game is not there, the competition to get farther than the other team, and stop the other team at all costs (no versus campaign)-AI is better at handling AI. Since the game is about unlocking things, you want to complete runs. The game rewards teamwork so much it is better to have AI BOTS on your team rather than human players. Since it is only AI campaign, AI will help you get farther than human teammates. If there were human competition on the other team, then you actually might appreciate having humans on your team. -Swarm Mode is the mode to play against other players. It just has little to it. You try and kill the other team faster while you hold out as long as you can. Good in theory, but players just end up leaving after it is clear one team is better, or even sooner. There isn\'t anything to strive for if your team isn\'t good.I like the game, I bought it because I loved L4D so much, it will be fun for a while; but I can tell there won\'t be anything to keep me playing once the nostalgia passes.

After updating nvidia drivers so far so good. You mileage may vary.- Environments are awesome. Environment puzzles while easy still deliver.- Combat while its not too difficult is fine. Enemies for example use obstacles to break line of sight, try to execute strategy like behavior and in other ways a bit better than your average cannon fodder. Pleasant surprise here.- No micro-transactions, grind, repetitive or other things I hate (it is so sad that it is worth mentioning these days)- Soundtrack is nothing short but great- From other reviews it looks like game would take more than 6 hours to beat while not rushing and enjoying the processYes, I really enjoy this game.

Either just passive banter during missions or active conversations on the ship.Just be clear this is inspired more by the comics and not the movies.

Throughout the game you\'ll visit different planets and space stations and each has a unique visual. Lush and colourful, filled with detail and giving you some space to explore. Now, it isn\'t open world, in fact the levels are pretty linear, though they do give you some corners to explore, in which you can find some goodies, either to improve your weapons/skills or new outfits you can put on.Together with the visuals, the music is a standout as well, blasting you with some great 80s hits. Especially when you use your \"huddle\" skill in combat, in which you gather your team and give a (more or less) inspiring speech to boost your combat prowess, it just feels great to be blasting away enemies to AHA\'s \"Take on Me\" or Europe\'s \"The Final Countdown\".The rest of the original score isn\'t necessarily something that you\'ll remember, but it\'s serviceable and fits the scenes usually pretty well.The story starts out rather slow and takes quite a turn throughout the playthrough, but it\'s captivating and has some seriously touching moments in it, for everyone of the teammembers. Everyone gets their screentime and they all get a bit of depth, background story and issues they are dealing with.Combat is a bit of a mess overall. Everyone of your teammates can have up to 4 different skills you can activate manually in fights, as do you as Star-Lord himself. You also upgrade your weapon throughout the game, so you can have 4 different elemental damages as secondary shots, besides your normal laser shot. Throughout some of the \"battle arenas\" there also some items your teammates can activate, or throw for some extra damage, and there\'s the \"Huddle\" as mentioned previous, in which you can motivate your team if you say the right phrase and boost your combat skills.Overall it feels a bit stuffed and clunky to control, at least with mouse and keyboard.It\'s defenitely not bad, and can be quite fun at times, though sometimes it also feels frustratingly chaotic.There are a lot of difficulty settings you can manually change, from damage received, to cooldown times etc. which is pretty great - this way, you can more gradually choose how hard or not you want the fights to be, without feeling too overpowered.I had a few technical hiccups throughout the game as well. Nothing gamebreaking, but i needed to reload the last checkpoit a few times, as some events didn\'t trigger properly and i think 2 times i lost my team after using an elevator.The checkpoints are usually pretty generous and even if you fall to your \"death\" in a level, you\'ll immediately pop up where you fell, without any downsides or malus.Overall, the story and characters are what\'s making this game so good for me, the combat isn\'t great but serviceable, but definitely gets your blood pumping when the 80s hits start blasting over your speakers.Would definitely recommend for people who love a story-driven game with entertaining characters and some combat and puzzles in between that gives a bit of variety.', 1, '2021-10-29 19:05:43', NULL),

Similiar to Warriors of The Nile which I found to be harder at times. My first run I managed to get to the boss in battle 4 but ultimately met my end there. But I can see how some abilities could be very over powered if played right. The core gameplay loop is fun and the game had me wanting to come back for more. The battles were fairly quick and varied enough to keep it interesting. Overall a solid game and I look forward to seeing if we get some added features down the road such as more varied heroes, maps, towers and traps. Gameplay Videohttps://youtu.be/wOOzvN4x-HgGameplay LoopThe gameplay loop consists of running through battles with 3 player controlled heroes and 3 AI controlled towers, along with a couple of traps, the battles involve multiple waves of enemies and the main objective is to stop them from damaging your rook. As you progress through these battles, you can augment and upgrade your heroes, towers and traps to strengthen them and adapt to your play style. If you get defeated then you gain gems which can provide permanent increases to your heroes, towers or traps which will then make the next run a bit easier.

The game is really easy to pick up, yet hard to master, due to a ton of different upgrades and interactions between heroes, turrets and traps. There\'s also a lot of unlockable content (new heroes, towers, spells and such), offering even more options to mix and match and build new strategies.What I liked:The game really surprised me with the smooth gameplay from the beginning. Everything is easy to understand, yet there are so many different upgrades for the heroes, creating complexity while you progress - feels good and fun to learn. There\'s also a lot of unlockables and different stuff which immediately made me happy to see. Several new difficulty levels offer a pretty long gameplay experience. What I didn\'t like:I dislike the \"unlock\" system in general, artificially lowering my options from the beginning. This is a necessary evil for Roguelites and probably also a personal preference. In general there isn\'t much to mutter about, the biggest issue being not too many innovations - every element of Defend The Rook has been seen somewhere else, somehow. It\'s not really a glaring issue though, cause the mixture of \"borrowed elements\" turned into something truly new and enjoyable. But this one won\'t set new standards either. My summary:The game is totally worth your time if you like Turn Based Combat and/or Tower Defense. There\'s a lot to do and it\'s really dirty cheap on top of that. Defend The Rook is easy to learn, offering entertainment very quickly, while offering a lot of depth with crazy upgrade combos. Definitely worth the buy!', 1, '2021-10-27 13:13:17', NULL),

Tower\'s don\'t move and use AI targeting, while units you have full control over. After each wave you\'ll be presented with one of three options to upgrade one hero. There\'s rarity involved so some runs can just be worn with an early high roll. After 4 waves you face a final boss wave which gives a high rarity upgrade. You have a small break to spend xp and gold on upgrading heroes or towers. Each run the \"tree\" of each unit is randomized, which does keep a freshness to each run. Also with randomizing the spells you start with.This game, for me, is lacking in two areas. Difficulty and hero diversity. As a note, I haven\'t unlocked each character. There\'s a total of three classes of units, a frontliner, an rogueish character, and a mage. While each unit feels very different from another, the alternatives don\'t feel too different from the base. The roguish category suffers from this the least and the mage the most. I personally feel that not dying when killed is just better than four armor is you didn\'t move, so there\'s also a small lack of balance between the alternatives.The bigger problem is just the game isn\'t that hard. I\'m pretty experienced with roguelikes though. It took me to ascension 4 to have a rocky run. Even then I still beat it. I currently have yet to lose a run. You\'re bound in a run to get one of the too powerful cards. Here\'s my highlights.My warrior has range 6 and auto kills any unit at 48 hp or less after an attack. He also get\'s to attack a second time if he kills a unit.Or my most powerful runMy mage chains lightning for 18 damage at range 5 and stuns everyone hit. Whenever a unit dies all enemy units take 6.Or My mage attacks everyone within 6 range for 30 damage, if she kills a unit she can attack again. This was my first run and the final boss was usually just me attacking with her twice, wiping the board, making the boss go invulnerable, and then having everyone else on my team sit around.It\'s not a bad game, it\'s a really well made game. If you\'re not looking for a balls to the wall hard roguelike here\'s a great place to start. I would heavily recommend giving it a try if that\'s your cup of tea.

If you enjoy both TBS and TD genres, this game will be a fun addition to your library. For people who like the idea of the TD genre but who may find the active and continuous enemy movements to be stressful, this game allows you to think before you move, thus making it more accessible as well.GameplayThe game provides a separate tutorial, and it is very easy to understand.The game is set up in a level-by-level basis, with five waves within each level. The final wave is always a boss wave and they are pretty difficult. I think there are five levels total, but I have yet to beat the fifth level at this time.Even though there is some kind of a story between the levels, I was not paying that much attention to it. I was eager to move forward to the next level usually.The battlefield is set up so that you have the rook, which must stay alive, and also three heroes along with three towers. You can unlock more heroes later by winning levels. The towers can be placed whenever during the level. The towers attack at the beginning of each turn. However, if you lose a tower in a prior wave, you will not have access to the same tower until you complete the level. You can move your heroes around on the map, and they can attack or use items to impede enemy progress.After each wave, you will be presented with three random buffs; of course you will pick the one most suitable for your situation/need.The game is a roguelite, with the run ending if your rook dies. During your run, you will earn gemstones after completing each level, and they allow you to make some upgrades for the next run.GraphicsThe graphics look very good, and I really enjoy this art style.MusicThe music is not outstanding in any way.ControlsThe game can be fully played with a mouse.PricingThe game offers fun and challenging gameplay, with plenty of things to unlock. Gameplay Videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V8UMjQo0LUVerdictDefend the Rook is a really fun game. I really enjoy both turn-based strategy and tower defense style games and by combing the two and allowing me time to think, I found it to be less stressful than the standard TD games. The gameplay is engaging and fun, while also presenting a certain degree of a challenge. I have yet to complete a run, but I think I am rather close.I can recommend this game for sure.Verdict: 8/10I received the product for free. I did not receive any compensation to write this review.

Three out of five times they failed and I would have to close out and re-play a chapter multiple times so that someone was not killed because of this. This meant I would have to listen to the same childish dialogue again which is probably why it annoyed me so much. Going to mouse and keyboard improved QTE successes, but it still read some as wrong.

Problem is I can\'t aim very well with my mouse on the bed, nor can I aim particularly well on a controller.

Plus with a giant a$$ 4K gaming TV, it helps me immerse better in a game that\'s designed to be super immersive.For the above reason, I own every game these guys make, twice in fact for a few of them (on PS4 too). and I have a blast every time. I still can\'t quite get my head around whatever the hell happened last year in Little Hope, so I\'ll have to go back to that one for a replay soon.But House of Ashes, I feel was truly the best in the series. It starts a little slow, a bit weak sauce, but once you get deeper into the chapters it starts to really get exciting. And the deeper you go, the crazier it gets. So whilst I definitely recommended buying the full Dark Pictures series, I\'d say even if its your first one, this is the right one to pick. There are some Little Hope references in it so that might make you pick that one up too, just to see how it all connects.With this game series, one of the rewards for beating the game is it shows you the NEXT upcoming game. So next October, fans will get another game added to the series, and thats already looking pretty sick too. As I said earlier, I played this on the highest settings on my 4K TV, there was absolutely no lag or input issues, the game was smooth as a whistle with no issues stopping and starting. it played as you would expect it to on a console with perfect fluidity. My GPU is the 980ti, so it\'s getting on a bit in age now, but still performed perfect on this game.So if you want an immersive experience where you can distract yourself from the real world and engage in the plight of others - I say pay full price and go for it.

However that part is fairly short and in my opinion, the best part about the game. Extremely fun, very well made, and reminds me of a better Slay the Spire in a way.I\'d be very happy if they released an option to grind out the \"endlessness\" of Act 1 with tons new bosses and cards after you complete the main story. OR even release it as a DLC, I wouldn\'t mind. Act 2 is extremely different to Act 2 except for the fact that you\'re fighting bosses again. It\'s a completely different mode that I wasn\'t too much a fan of. The game turns into a 2d card collecting game with free control of he cards you put in your deck. Most fun I had in Act 2 was fighting a dummy over and over again :/ ( and completing all the secrets, but I always love that)Now Act 3 is where I\'m currently in at the time of this review. The game returns to 3d but with a new art style due to the character you\'re interacting with now. Once again new puzzles and a new format of play where you can freely move around a map is introduced, with various secrets and passage ways you can go to.While i do like the fact that the game is 3d once again, I have to say Act 1 is the best part of the whole game.

Act 1 is a lot of fun, and becouse of this i bought it. A Deckbuilder and a little bit of Hand of Fade. It¬¥s a lot of fun, it has its problems but fun. The totems, items and the different upgrades you can apply to your card, makes it versatile and each death is fun becouse you can create a card, which are super OP. There is a lack of variety in encounter and Bosses, but becouse the akt is so short (2-4h) that it dosn¬¥t feel boring. And than act 2. It sucked the Fun out of this Game. The gameplay chnges and gets rid of all the uniqe aspekts of this game. No Item, no totem and the \"you can draw a card beside your deck\" are gone, the art style and game type changes extremly, granted its a matter of tast, but both are worst. The Card matches are encounters that are alway the same. its not random, the cards of the enemy are always in the same order in the same position, and a lose has no consequences, so it becouse a thing of \"try again\". ACT 2 SUCKS. And if I had only play two hour a the time I would have refunded the Game, and only when I read that there is a 3rd act I sufferd to the end of akt 2 to see the 3rd act.Act 3 goes back to the art and gameplay style of act 1, which makes it instantly better, in my opinion its not as good as act 1 but way better as act 2.Act 1: Good game, unique and fun aspects.Act 2: A boring ugly uninspired game, gets rid of all what makes act 1 great and replaced it with a nothing really.Act 3: quite good, gets back to what makes act 1 good and makes them fit to the theme of act 3.If act 2 would not be in this my criticism would be the lack of variety, which can maybe said becouse they had to put act 2 in there. the same time and manpower on a act for the wizard and necro or 2 or 3 more for the boss encounters and this game would be fantastic.If you are ok with act 2 than buy this game. If not there are other, way better deckbuilding games that you don¬¥t have to suffer through a extremly ugly boring 2nd act.ps.: on top of this, I think that I am angry becouse this game advertised only act 1, so you go in with the aspektation of a deckbuilding roueglike/-lite. The demo all videos and screenshots are only from act 1. And I know gecouse of the twist, but when the twist is a completly differend game and it turns out the reason you bought the game is just a small part of it, than it should be mentioned somewhere. It a form of fals advertisment,', 1, '2021-10-28 19:43:43', NULL),
